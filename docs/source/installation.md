# Installation guide

Move the 3 wiki pages over to here.

with sphinx_design we can have common content in a single place,
and whenever there is some specific guidance that depends on OS use
tabs, which can be syncronized. That is, if one tab is switched over to
windows, all tabs will be moved to windows.
