## Step 2 overview
Links to beginner lever notebooks. For example,
thanks to intersphinx, we can cite the getting started
notebook with {doc}`nb:getting_started` (the path in pymc-examples repo excluding
the `examples` folder, or using manual anchors if we decide to create them).

## Step 3 overview

Links to intermediate notebooks. {doc}`More about step 3... <learn/step3>`
